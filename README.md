#  ExamplePDF

Example of a small SwiftUI app with PDF generation from the same data (for macOS 11).

[PDF generator is TPPDF, MIT licensed.](https://github.com/techprimate/TPPDF/)

This is intended as an example specific to pre-Table and pre-ImageRenderer versions of SwiftUI,
and on macOS where we don't have some of the creature comforts of iOS.

Icon's produced by [Bakery, an awesome insta-icon generator for development assets](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bakery-simple-icon-creator/id1575220747?mt=12).
